# React examples in JSFiddle.
JSFiddle examples of React can be very useful, being more convienent then cloning a Github example. The main drawback to remember is that they do not have code broken into modules, limiting their usefulness outside of examples.

## React base fiddle.
This is the super basic example directly linked from React's docs. It shows the very basics of React.
If you want to play with React in JSFiddle, or create a testcase or example, this is a great base to fork from.

## My examples

### React base using ES2015 (also called ES6) `class` syntax.
This is the React base fiddle modified to use a class. React is going toward using and recommending class syntax, though their docs don't quite show it yet.

### Rendering to multiple React components.
If you are integrating React into a current application, you might only have React render part of the page. This example shows how to do that, while still rendering state into a single function.

### External and internal updating
This example shows an external function updating state that is rendered to React, as well as a function passed to a component which listens to an event inside a React component.
- *[React, rendering, external rendering. React.createClass version.](https://jsfiddle.net/samsch/eg9ed9ez/)
- *[React, rendering, external rendering. Class syntax version.](https://jsfiddle.net/samsch/wg86and0/)

*These examples do not show great application structure. They are purpose-built to be as simple as possible to explain their specific topic.
